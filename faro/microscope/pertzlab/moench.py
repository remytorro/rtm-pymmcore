        """Confirm the Nikon Ti cube turret reached the cube this channel asks
        for; on a detected mismatch, force a physical move and re-check.

        Why: the closed NikonTI adapter decides whether to move the turret by
        comparing the requested position against an internal, callback-fed
        position cache, and silently skips the move when they're equal
        ("Already at position; not moving" -- no exception, no error log). A
        missed/mis-filtered position callback desyncs that cache, so a needed
        cube change can be dropped and the frame acquired through the wrong
        cube. Unlike XY/Z, the filter block has no independent re-read or
        safety timeout in the adapter -- we add one here. See
        ``nikonti-re/FINDINGS.md`` for the disassembly this is based on.

        Strategy (cheap by default; an extra rotation only on a miss):
          1. read the turret back; if it equals the target, return (the common
             case -- one fast read, no extra movement);
          2. on mismatch, force a real move by first going to a *neighbour*
             position (which breaks the ``target == cache`` equality the
             adapter uses to suppress the move) and then to the target,
             re-checking each time;
          3. if it still won't land, log loudly (and optionally raise) so a
             long run surfaces the failure instead of silently collecting
             wrong-cube data.

        Detection note: the read-back goes through the same cache the adapter
        compares against, so it cannot catch the rarer case where the cache
        *wrongly* equals the target. Forcing the move unconditionally would,
        but at the cost of doubling turret wear on every change -- not
        acceptable at this rig's ~15 s cadence. If misses persist, the robust
        fix is a direct-COM Ti backend (see ``nikonti-re/HANDOFF.md``).
