    """Intermediate base for all pymmcore-plus-based microscopes.

    Subclasses must set ``self.mmc`` to a ``CMMCorePlus`` instance.

    Implements the :class:`AbstractMicroscope` MDA interface by delegating
    to ``self.mmc`` (run_mda, frameReady signal, cancel, etc.).

    Power properties (mapping channel config -> light-source device/property)
    are declared explicitly per microscope via ``POWER_PROPERTIES``. A
    ``PowerChannel`` whose config is not mapped raises in
    :meth:`resolve_power` rather than silently dropping the requested power.

    On construction, an atexit hook is registered that cancels any running
    MDA and unloads every Micro-Manager device when the interpreter shuts
    down. Without this, device adapters can stay bound to the dying Python
    process and prevent the next process from acquiring the same
    configuration. Subclasses with extra teardown (background threads,
    serial ports, etc.) should override :meth:`_teardown_hardware` rather
    than re-register their own hooks.
