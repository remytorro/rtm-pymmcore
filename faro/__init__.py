"""FARO -- Feedback Adaptive Real-time Optogenetics."""

# Force pymmcore-plus to use the synchronous psygnal signal backend BEFORE
# any submodule import can pull in pymmcore_widgets, which sets
# PYMM_SIGNALS_BACKEND='qt' via os.environ.setdefault at its own import.
# napari-micromanager transitively imports pymmcore_widgets, so a notebook
# that did `import napari_micromanager` before any faro import would
# otherwise lock the backend to 'qt' -- routing core.mda.events.frameReady
# through Qt's queued delivery and silently starving the controller's
# pipeline whenever the main thread is busy. faro's async controller
# (RunHandle / run_experiment) needs the data path direct + synchronous on
# the engine thread, so we set this *explicitly* and *hard* (not setdefault):
# pymmcore_widgets's own setdefault wins whenever it imports first, so faro
# can only get its way by overriding outright. pymmcore-plus reads this env
# lazily (in pymmcore_plus._util.signals_backend(), at each signaler
# construction in CMMCorePlus / MDARunner), so this line still takes effect
# as long as it runs before any CMMCorePlus is instantiated or any
# mmc.mda is first accessed -- which `import faro` (or `from faro...`)
# guarantees, since it precedes the faro-side Moench() call that does so.
#
# Headless paths are unaffected: with no Qt around, pymmcore-plus would
# pick psygnal anyway. Setting this is a no-op there.
