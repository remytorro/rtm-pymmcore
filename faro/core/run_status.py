"""Status reporting + cancellation handle for asynchronous experiment runs.

``Controller.run_experiment`` returns a ``RunHandle``. The handle owns:

* the worker thread driving the MDA feed loop,
* a cooperative cancellation event,
* an immutable ``RunStatus`` snapshot that the controller's threads update
  via :meth:`RunHandle.update`,
* a ``statusChanged`` :mod:`psygnal` signal that UI widgets (and any other
  observer) can subscribe to for live updates.

The handle is thread-safe: callers and the worker can both read ``status()``
and the worker can call ``update(...)`` without coordination from the
caller. Status updates emit ``statusChanged`` synchronously; with ``qtpy``
loaded :mod:`psygnal` routes the emission to listeners' threads through
Qt's queued connections, so a napari widget connected on the main thread
sees a queued slot call from the worker without extra plumbing.
