    Replaces ``queue.SimpleQueue`` in places where values must be associated

    by thread-wait-arrival-order; concurrent pipeline workers could beat
    earlier frames to the queue and mix up which value went with which
    frame (see the TracksDispenser bug rationale — same pattern applies to
    stim masks and any other per-frame handoff).

    Values are keyed by an integer frame index (``event.index["t"]``).

    Reads:

    - :meth:`get_predecessor` — wait for the most recent put *before* this
      frame, walking past skipped frames. Used for tracking where frame N
      needs frame N-1's accumulated df. Prunes entries ``<=`` the consumed
      predecessor automatically.
    - :meth:`wait_for_frame` — wait for *this* frame's put, blocking if
      not yet resolved. **Non-consuming** — the entry stays put so
      multiple readers can see it. Used for stim masks where both the
      stim event and the pipeline's storage step read the same mask.
      Callers must :meth:`prune_below` explicitly.
    - :meth:`peek_at_frame` — non-blocking, non-consuming variant of
      :meth:`wait_for_frame`.

    All three return ``None`` when the frame was skipped (or absent, for
    ``peek``).
