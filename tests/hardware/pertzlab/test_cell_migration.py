"""Hardware smoke test: end-to-end cell migration acquisition.

Converted from ``experiments/21_cell_migration/cell_migration.ipynb``.
Runs a short multi-FOV / multi-timestep acquisition with cellpose
segmentation, trackpy tracking, ``StimPercentageOfCell`` DMD
stimulation, and an optocheck reference channel on the last frame
(exercises the ref-channel write path).

Why this test exists:
    The notebook is the canonical end-to-end demo for the segmentation
    + tracking + per-cell stimulation pipeline. Converting it to a
    pytest target lets us validate the whole stack against real
    hardware in CI-style runs without needing napari or interactive
    FOV selection.

Differences from the notebook (intentional, for test ergonomics):
    * No napari / napari-micromanager. FOV positions come from the
      ``safe_positions`` fixture as relative offsets from the stage's
      current XY (max 40 µm), so the stage never makes a large move.
    * Output goes to pytest's ``tmp_path`` (auto-cleaned) instead of
      a hardcoded drive letter.
    * Segmentation is local (cellpose) instead of remote
      (imaging-server-kit) so the test doesn't depend on a separate
      server being reachable.
    * The DMD affine matrix is the synthetic identity from
      ``synthetic_affine`` — no interactive calibration step.
    * Frame count and interval are scaled down (4 frames × 2 s) so
      the whole test stays short.

The test is gated by ``--scope`` / ``FARO_SCOPE`` and skipped by
default. See ``tests/conftest.py`` for the gating logic.
