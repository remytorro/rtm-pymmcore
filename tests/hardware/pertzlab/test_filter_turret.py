"""Hardware verification: filter-cube turret changes actually land.

The closed NikonTI adapter (``TIFilterBlock1``) can *silently skip* a cube
change when its internal, callback-maintained position cache already equals
the target ("Already at position; not moving" -- no exception, no error log).
A missed/mis-filtered position callback desyncs that cache, so a genuinely
needed cube change can vanish and the frame is acquired through the wrong
cube. Unlike the XY/Z stages, the turret has no independent re-read or safety
timeout in the adapter, so ``MoenchMDAEngine._verify_filter_block`` adds one:
after each channel change it reads the turret back and, on a mismatch, forces
a real move (neighbour -> target, defeating the "already at position" skip).
See ``nikonti-re/FINDINGS.md`` for the disassembly this is based on.

This test is the turret analogue of a filter-wheel-change test: it drives the
turret through the *distinct* cubes of the multi-cube channel group (unlike
``TTL_ERK``, every channel of which shares one cube) via the engine's
channel-set path -- the same path an MDA uses -- and asserts the turret
reports the commanded cube after every change.

Gated by ``--scope`` / ``FARO_SCOPE``.
