"""Hardware smoke test: end-to-end line-stimulation acquisition.

Converted from ``experiments/22_line_stimulation/line_stimulation.ipynb``.
Runs a short multi-FOV / multi-timestep acquisition with a moving-line
DMD pattern. No segmentation, tracking, or feature extraction — this
exercises the geometric ``StimLine`` path on its own. The optocheck
reference channel is acquired on the last frame to validate ref-channel
handling without segmentation.

Why this test exists:
    The notebook is the canonical demo for the "stim independent of
    cell labels" pipeline shape. It's the simplest hardware path —
    image, stim with a precomputed mask, image, repeat — and a useful
    early signal that the camera + DMD + filter wheel + LED + writer
    chain is wired correctly.

Differences from the notebook (intentional, for test ergonomics):
    * No napari / napari-micromanager. FOV positions come from the
      ``safe_positions`` fixture as relative offsets from the stage's
      current XY (max 40 µm), so the stage never makes a large move.
    * No ``fovs.json`` file dependency.
    * Output goes to pytest's ``tmp_path`` (auto-cleaned) instead of
      a hardcoded drive letter.
    * The DMD affine matrix is the synthetic identity from
      ``synthetic_affine`` — no interactive calibration step.
    * Frame count and interval are scaled down (4 frames × 2 s) so
      the whole test stays short.

The test is gated by ``--scope`` / ``FARO_SCOPE`` and skipped by
default. See ``tests/conftest.py`` for the gating logic.
