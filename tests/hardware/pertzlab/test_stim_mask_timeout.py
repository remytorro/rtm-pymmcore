"""Hardware verification: stim-mask timeout surfaces as background error.

PR #3 changed stim-mask timeouts from a silent fall-through to a typed
``BackgroundError`` recorded on the controller. This test forces the
condition by pairing a deliberately short ``stim_mask_timeout`` on the
Analyzer with a deliberately slow stimulator, then verifies:

- the acquisition still finishes cleanly (log-and-continue),
- at least one ``BackgroundError`` with source=``stim_mask_timeout``
  (or similarly labeled) is recorded on the controller,
- the writer still produced an OME-Zarr store and events.json.

Because ``assert_clean_run`` fails on any background error, this test
inlines its own post-run assertions instead.

Gated by ``--scope`` / ``FARO_SCOPE`` like the other hardware tests.
