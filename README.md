# FARO: Real-time feedback control microscopy for automation of optogenetic targeting
**FARO** (**F**eedback **A**daptive **R**eal-time **O**ptogenetics, also *lighthouse* in Spanish) acquires images, segments cells, extracts features, tracks them over time, and generates stimulation masks, all while the experiment is running. This enables closed-loop feedback control: stimulation patterns can be computed from the latest segmentation and applied within the same or next timepoint.

```
**Microscope**: hardware interface. Any microscope that implements [useq-schema](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/useq-schema) can be used. Works great with Micro-Manager / [pymmcore-plus](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus).

**Pipeline**: modular image processing. Performs segmentation, tracking, feature extraction. Decides if/where to photoactivate the sample.

**Controller**: experiment orchestrator. Queues acquisition events to the microscope, dispatches frames to the pipeline, and coordinates stimulation timing. A simulated controller (`ControllerSimulated`) can replay pre-acquired data from disk for testing or re-analysis.

## Quickstart

Try **`experiments/02_demo_sim_optogenetic/`** notebook to run a complete optogenetic feedback experiment on a simulated microscope, no hardware required.

```python
# 1. Set microscope
mic = UniMMCoreSimulation(mmc=mmc)
mic.init_scope()

# 2. Assemble image processing pipeline
pipeline = ImageProcessingPipeline(
    storage_path="/path/to/experiment",
    segmentators=[SegmentationMethod("labels", OtsuSegmentator(), use_channel=0, save_tracked=True)],
    feature_extractor=SimpleFE("labels"),
    tracker=TrackerTrackpy(),
    stimulator=MoveUp(),
)

# 3. Define experiment parameters
events = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 5.0, "loops": 20},
    stage_positions=[{"x": 256, "y": 256}],
    channels=[{"config": "BF", "exposure": 50}],
    stim_channels=[{"config": "Cyan", "exposure": 50}],
    stim_frames=range(5, 20),
)

# 4. Run!
ctrl = Controller(mic, pipeline)
handle = ctrl.run_experiment(list(events), stim_mode="current")
handle.wait()  # run_experiment is non-blocking; wait() blocks until done
```

## Pipeline

The pipeline is modular, each component is independent and can be swapped or set to `None`.

| Component | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Segmentation** | Identify cells in images | `OtsuSegmentator`, `SegmentorCellpose`, `SegmentatorStardist`, remote via [imaging-server-kit](https://github.com/imaging-server-kit) |
| **Stimulation** | Generate masks for DMD/SLM | `StimWholeFOV`, `StimPercentageOfCell`, `CenterCircle`, `StimLine` |
| **Feature extraction** | Measure cell properties | `SimpleFE` (position, area), `FE_ErkKtr` (ERK-KTR c/n ratio) |
| **Tracking** | Link cells across frames | `TrackerTrackpy` (via [trackpy](https://github.com/soft-matter/trackpy)), `TrackerMotile` (ILP via [motile](https://github.com/funkelab/motile), supports divisions/merges) |

```python
pipeline = ImageProcessingPipeline(
    storage_path="/path/to/experiment",
    segmentators=segmentators,  # list of SegmentationMethod
    feature_extractor=fe,
    tracker=tracker,
    stimulator=stimulator,
    feature_extractor_ref=ref_fe,  # optional: for reference acquisition frames
)
```
## Controller

The Controller converts RTMEvents to MDAEvents, queues them through the microscope, and dispatches frames to the pipeline.

### Experiment Definition

Experiments are defined as `RTMSequence` objects — an extension of useq's `MDASequence`. Compose multi-step experiments with `combine()`, which supports two modes of composition via the `axis` argument:

```python
from faro.core.data_structures import Channel, PowerChannel, RTMSequence, combine
```

**Sequential phases (`axis="t"`).** Each phase runs after the previous one, same positions, with `t` indices and wall-clock times offset automatically:

```python
baseline = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 60.0, "loops": 100},
    stage_positions=fov_positions,
    channels=[{"config": "miRFP", "exposure": 300}],
)
treatment = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 60.0, "loops": 150},
    stage_positions=fov_positions,
    channels=[{"config": "miRFP", "exposure": 300}],
)
washout = RTMSequence(...)

events = combine(baseline, treatment, washout, axis="t")
```

**Parallel sub-experiments (`axis="p"`).** Two (or more) setups running concurrently on different subsets of FOVs — useful when FOVs need different stim patterns, different stim schedules, or different treatment metadata, but should share the clock. Each sub-experiment keeps its own `stim_frames` and `rtm_metadata`:

```python
setup_a = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 10.0, "loops": 100},
    stage_positions=fovs_1_to_5,
    channels=[{"config": "miRFP", "exposure": 300}],
    stim_channels=(stim_pattern_a,),
    stim_frames={10, 20, 30},
    rtm_metadata={"treatment": "DMSO"},
)
setup_b = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 10.0, "loops": 100},
    stage_positions=fovs_6_to_10,
    channels=[{"config": "miRFP", "exposure": 300}],  # must match setup_a
    stim_channels=(stim_pattern_b,),
    stim_frames={15, 25, 35},
    rtm_metadata={"treatment": "drug"},
)

events = combine(setup_a, setup_b, axis="p")
# At each timepoint: FOVs 0-4 image with setup_a's stim schedule,
# FOVs 5-9 image with setup_b's — all in parallel on the same clock.
```

**Precondition for `axis="p"`:** all sub-experiments must declare the same imaging channels. The writer allocates a single channel set across all positions, so heterogeneous channels per FOV are not supported today (tracked for the eventual useq-schema v2 migration). A `ValueError` is raised at call time if channel configs differ.

`combine()` is variadic (`combine(a, b, c, d, ..., axis=...)`), handles the N=0 and N=1 degenerate cases, and is the only composition primitive — there is deliberately no shorthand operator, so every multi-step experiment reads the composition axis explicitly.

**Timed waits between phases.** `wait(seconds)` inserts a fixed-duration pause — e.g. to let cells recover before stimulating. It acquires no frames and just delays everything after it:

```python
from faro.core.data_structures import wait

events = combine(baseline, wait(60), stim_phase, axis="t")
```

### Stimulation

Stimulation channels are acquired on specific frames, controlled via DMD/SLM. Define them with `stim_channels` and `stim_frames`:

```python
seq = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 5.0, "loops": 50},
    stage_positions=fov_positions,
    channels=[{"config": "miRFP", "exposure": 300}],
    stim_channels=(PowerChannel(config="CyanStim", exposure=200, power=10),),
    stim_frames=range(10, 50),
)
```

**Stimulation modes** (set via `ctrl.run_experiment(events, stim_mode=...)`):
* `"current"`: acquire frame, wait for segmentation mask, then stimulate in the same timepoint
* `"previous"`: stimulate using the mask from the previous timepoint, then acquire

### Reference Acquisition

Reference channels are acquired on specific frames for one-time measurements whose features are broadcast to all timepoints — e.g., checking expression of an optogenetic tool, or a high-resolution image that would bleach the sample. Define them with `ref_channels` and `ref_frames`:

```python
seq = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 5.0, "loops": 50},
    stage_positions=fov_positions,
    channels=[{"config": "miRFP", "exposure": 300}],
    ref_channels=(Channel(config="mCitrine", exposure=600),),
    ref_frames={-1},  # last frame only
)
```

Alternatively, define the reference as a separate phase and chain it with `combine`:

```python
experiment = RTMSequence(time_plan=..., channels=..., ...)
ref_phase  = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 0, "loops": 1},
    stage_positions=fov_positions,
    channels=[{"config": "mCitrine", "exposure": 600}],
    rtm_metadata={"img_type": ImgType.IMG_REF},
)
events = combine(experiment, ref_phase, axis="t")
```

### Frame Specification

Both `stim_frames` and `ref_frames` accept:
* **Sets**: `{0, 5, 10}` — specific frames
* **Ranges**: `range(10, 50)` or `range(0, 50, 2)` — contiguous or strided
* **Negative indices**: `-1` = last frame, `-2` = second-to-last

### Axis Order

`axis_order` controls the nesting of time, position, and channel dimensions (inherited from useq's `MDASequence`). The default is `"tpcz"`:

| `axis_order` | Iteration | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `"tpcz"` (default) | All positions at t=0, then all at t=1, ... | Maximize temporal resolution per position |
| `"ptcz"` | All timepoints at p=0, then all at p=1, ... | Complete one position before moving to the next |

```python
# Visit all 3 positions at each timepoint before advancing
seq = RTMSequence(
    time_plan={"interval": 5.0, "loops": 50},
    stage_positions=[(0, 0, 0), (100, 100, 0), (200, 200, 0)],
    channels=[{"config": "BF", "exposure": 50}],
    axis_order="tpcz",  # default: (t=0,p=0), (t=0,p=1), (t=0,p=2), (t=1,p=0), ...
)

# Complete all timepoints at each position before moving on
seq = RTMSequence(
    ...,
    axis_order="ptcz",  # (t=0,p=0), (t=1,p=0), ..., (t=49,p=0), (t=0,p=1), ...
)
```

Stimulation and reference channels are assigned per-timepoint, so they work correctly regardless of axis order. For example, `stim_frames={3}` stimulates all positions at t=3, whether they are visited consecutively (`tpcz`) or spread across the run (`ptcz`).

### FOV Batching

When an experiment has more FOV positions than can be imaged within a single timepoint interval, FOV batching automatically partitions positions into sequential batches with adjusted timing.

```python
from faro.core.utils import check_fov_batching, apply_fov_batching

events = list(seq)

# Check whether all FOVs fit in one batch
check_fov_batching(events, time_per_fov=2.0)

# If not, split into batches with adjusted timing
events = apply_fov_batching(events, time_per_fov=2.0)
```

`check_fov_batching` computes how many FOVs fit in parallel (`interval / time_per_fov`) and reports whether batching is needed. `apply_fov_batching` offsets overflow FOVs into subsequent batches so that each batch runs within the interval. Timepoint indices are adjusted so the imaging order remains physically sensible.

### Running

```python
from faro.core.controller import Controller

ctrl = Controller(mic, pipeline)
handle = ctrl.run_experiment(events, stim_mode="current")
handle.wait()  # block until the run finishes
```

`validate_events()` runs automatically before the experiment starts (disable with `validate=False`). It checks both pipeline compatibility and hardware limits.

`run_experiment()` and `continue_experiment()` are **non-blocking** — they return a `RunHandle` so the kernel stays free (e.g. to use the napari viewer). Call `handle.wait()` to block until the run finishes.

```python
handle = ctrl.run_experiment(events, stim_mode="current")
handle.pause(); handle.resume()   # stop/resume acquiring; schedule is preserved
handle.cancel()                   # graceful stop
handle.wait()                     # block until done

# Live status badge, progress strip, and Pause/Stop buttons in napari:
from faro.widgets import ExperimentStatusWidget
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(ExperimentStatusWidget(ctrl), area="right")
```

### Experiment Continuation

Call `run_experiment()` once, then `continue_experiment()` to append more phases. The Analyzer (and all per-FOV tracking state) is reused, so timesteps, filenames, and particle IDs continue seamlessly.

```python
ctrl = Controller(mic, pipeline)

# Phase 1: baseline — find cells, measure growth rate
phase1 = RTMSequence(time_plan={"interval": 10, "loops": 60}, ...)
ctrl.run_experiment(phase1, validate=False).wait()  # wait() before reading results

# Analyse phase-1 results to decide what to do next
df = pd.read_parquet("tracks/000_latest.parquet")
fast_growers = df.groupby("particle")["area"].apply(lambda x: x.diff().mean())

# Phase 2: stimulate based on analysis
phase2 = RTMSequence(time_plan={"interval": 10, "loops": 120}, ...)
ctrl.continue_experiment(phase2).wait()

# Always call finish_experiment() when done
ctrl.finish_experiment()
```

To add events while an experiment is still running, use `extend_experiment()`:

```python
ctrl.run_experiment(baseline_events, validate=False)  # runs in background thread
ctrl.extend_experiment(extra_events)                   # non-blocking, appends to running acquisition
```

| Method | When to use | Returns |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `run_experiment()` | First acquisition — creates a fresh Analyzer | `RunHandle` (non-blocking) |
| `continue_experiment()` | Subsequent phases — reuses Analyzer, offsets timesteps | `RunHandle` (non-blocking) |
| `extend_experiment()` | Mid-run additions — pushes events into the running loop | — (non-blocking) |
| `finish_experiment()` | Cleanup — shuts down Analyzer, resets state | — (blocks until drained) |

## Simulated Controller

`ControllerSimulated` loads pre-acquired images from disk instead of from the camera, enabling testing and re-analysis without hardware.

It supports both **TIFF** (`raw/`, `ref/` folders) and **OME-Zarr** (`acquisition.ome.zarr`) source layouts. When an OME-Zarr store is found, raw frames are read from zarr; reference images fall back to TIFFs in `ref/`.

```python
from faro.core.controller import ControllerSimulated

ctrl = ControllerSimulated(mic, pipeline, old_data_project_path="/path/to/old_experiment")
ctrl.run_experiment(events, stim_mode="current").wait()
```

Use cases:
- **Testing**: run the full pipeline on demo data without any microscope hardware
- **Re-analysis**: replay raw images through a new pipeline (different segmentation, tracking, etc.)
- **Validation**: verify analysis logic reproducibly on known data

See **`experiments/11_erk_experiments_full_fov_stim/stim_rtmsequence_demo_mic.ipynb`** for a working example.

## Re-analysis

The offline re-analysis pipeline (`ImageProcessingPipeline_postExperiment`) reprocesses images from a previous experiment with new segmentation, tracking, or feature extraction parameters — without re-acquiring.

```python
from faro.core.pipeline_post import ImageProcessingPipeline_postExperiment

pipeline = ImageProcessingPipeline_postExperiment(
    img_storage_path="/path/to/original_experiment",
    out_path="/path/to/new_output",
    events=events,
    segmentators=[SegmentationMethod("labels", SegmentorCellpose(), use_channel=0)],
    feature_extractor=FE_ErkKtr("labels"),
    tracker=TrackerTrackpy(),
    n_jobs=4,
)
pipeline.run()
```

Key features:
- **Dual input format**: reads from both TIFF and OME-Zarr source experiments
- **Reuse old segmentations**: set `use_old_segmentations=True` to skip re-segmenting and only recompute tracking/features
- **Parallel FOV processing**: uses `n_jobs` threads to process multiple FOVs concurrently
- **Hard-linking**: when outputting to OME-Zarr, raw data resolution levels are hard-linked instead of copied (falls back to copy on network shares)
- **Timestep gap correction**: `correct_timestep_jumps=True` backfills missing timesteps

See **`experiments/90_reanalysis/reanalysis.ipynb`** for a complete example.

## Storage

The pipeline writes acquired images, segmentation masks, and stimulation masks to disk. Three writer backends are available:

| Writer | Format | Best for |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `TiffWriter` | Individual TIFF files | Quick inspection, legacy compatibility |
| `OmeZarrWriter` | OME-Zarr v0.5 | Streaming acquisition, cloud-friendly, single multi-dimensional array |
| `OmeZarrWriterPlate` | OME-Zarr v0.5 (plate layout) | Multi-position experiments viewed as a spatial mosaic |

### OmeZarrWriter (default)


Streams all data into a single OME-Zarr v0.5 store. Raw images are stored as a single multi-dimensional array (t, c, y, x) for single-position experiments or (t, p, c, y, x) for multi-position experiments. Segmentation labels are stored as NGFF label groups.

```
experiment/
├── acquisition.ome.zarr/
│   ├── 0/                  raw data array
│   └── labels/
│       ├── labels/         segmentation masks
│       └── stim_mask/      stimulation masks
└── tracks/                 parquet files
```

```python
from faro.core.writers import OmeZarrWriter

writer = OmeZarrWriter(
    storage_path="/path/to/experiment",
    dtype="uint16",
    store_stim_images=False,       # True: include stim channels in raw array
    n_timepoints=None,             # None = unbounded (resizable)
    raw_chunk_t=1,                 # temporal chunk size for raw data
    label_shard_t=50,              # temporal shard size for labels
)

pipeline = ImageProcessingPipeline(
    storage_path="/path/to/experiment",
    writer=writer,
    ...
)
```

The stream is initialized automatically by the Controller before the first frame is written — no manual setup required.

### OmeZarrWriterPlate (plate layout)

Stores each FOV position as a separate well in an OME-Zarr plate. When opened in napari with `napari-ome-zarr`, positions are tiled spatially as a mosaic rather than stacked along a position slider. This makes it easy to get an overview of all positions at once.

```
experiment/
├── acquisition.ome.zarr/
│   ├── A/
│   │   ├── 1/             well for position 0
│   │   │   └── 0/         image group (t, c, y, x)
│   │   ├── 2/             well for position 1
│   │   └── ...
└── tracks/
```

```python
from faro.core.writers import OmeZarrWriterPlate

writer = OmeZarrWriterPlate(
    storage_path="/path/to/experiment",
    dtype="uint16",
)

pipeline = ImageProcessingPipeline(
    storage_path="/path/to/experiment",
    writer=writer,
    ...
)
```

### TiffWriter
Saves each frame as a separate compressed TIFF file:

```
experiment/
├── raw/          000_000.tiff, 000_001.tiff, ...
├── labels/       000_000.tiff, ...
├── stim_mask/    ...
└── tracks/       000_latest.parquet, ...
```

```python
from faro.core.writers import TiffWriter

pipeline = ImageProcessingPipeline(
    storage_path="/path/to/experiment",
    writer=TiffWriter("/path/to/experiment"),
    ...
)
```


### Viewing OME-Zarr Data

OME-Zarr files can be viewed with [napari](https://napari.org) using the [napari-ome-zarr](https://github.com/ome/napari-ome-zarr) plugin. The easiest way to install napari as a standalone tool is with `uv tool`:

```bash
uv tool install napari[pyqt6] --with napari-ome-zarr
```

This makes `napari` available as a global command. Open an OME-Zarr dataset directly from the terminal:

```bash
napari /path/to/experiment/acquisition.ome.zarr
```

You can also create a desktop shortcut pointing to the `napari` executable for quick access. To find its location:

```bash
uv tool dir
```

### Converting TIFF to OME-Zarr

Existing TIFF-based experiments can be migrated to OME-Zarr using the conversion utility:

```python
from faro.core.conversion import convert_tiff_to_omezarr

convert_tiff_to_omezarr(
    src_path="/path/to/tiff_experiment",
    dst_path="/path/to/omezarr_experiment",
)
```

## Microscope

The microscope provides the hardware interface. Any microscope that implements the useq-schema MDA protocol can be used, the Controller never depends on pymmcore-plus directly.

### Class Hierarchy

```
AbstractMicroscope                # useq MDA interface
  ├─ PyMMCoreMicroscope           # implements via pymmcore-plus / CMMCorePlus
  │    ├─ MMDemo                  # Micro-Manager demo hardware
  │    ├─ UniMMCoreSimulation     # simulated microscope
  │    ├─ PymmcoreProxyMic        # remote via pymmcore-proxy
  │    └─ pertzlab/
  │         ├─ Jungfrau
  │         ├─ Moench
  │         └─ Niesen
  └─ InscoperMicroscope           # implements via Inscoper SDK (planned)
```

### Interface

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `run_mda(event_iter)` | Start MDA acquisition, returns thread handle |
| `connect_frame(callback)` | Connect frameReady: `callback(img, event)` |
| `disconnect_frame(callback)` | Disconnect frameReady |
| `cancel_mda()` | Cancel running MDA |
| `resolve_group(config_name)` | Return channel group for a config name (optional) |
| `resolve_power(channel)` | Return `(device, property, power)` (optional) |
| `validate_hardware(events)` | Check events against hardware limits (optional) |
| `init_scope()` | Load config, set up hardware |
| `post_experiment()` | Cleanup after experiment |

`PyMMCoreMicroscope` implements the MDA methods via `CMMCorePlus`. Concrete subclasses typically only need `init_scope()`.

## Micro-Manager / pymmcore-plus

The `PyMMCoreMicroscope` branch uses [pymmcore-plus](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus) as its hardware layer. Each microscope needs a **Micro-Manager configuration file** with:

* Channel presets for each fluorophore (e.g., `GFP`, `mCherry`, `miRFP`)
* A `System > Startup` preset for initial hardware configuration
* Device properties for cameras, light sources, filter wheels, etc.

For microscopes with controllable light source power, define a `POWER_PROPERTIES` mapping so `PowerChannel` objects resolve to the correct device:

```python
POWER_PROPERTIES = {
    "CyanStim": ("Spectra", "Cyan_Level"),  # config_name -> (device, property)
}
```

## Adding Your Own Micro-Manager Microscope

Create a new file in `faro/microscope/` and inherit from `PyMMCoreMicroscope`:

```python
import pymmcore_plus
from faro.microscope.pymmcore import PyMMCoreMicroscope

class MyScope(PyMMCoreMicroscope):
    MICROMANAGER_PATH = "C:\\Program Files\\Micro-Manager-2.0"
    MICROMANAGER_CONFIG = "path/to/config.cfg"
    CHANNEL_GROUP = "Channel"

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        pymmcore_plus.use_micromanager(self.MICROMANAGER_PATH)
        self.mmc = pymmcore_plus.CMMCorePlus()
        self.init_scope()

    def init_scope(self):
        self.mmc.loadSystemConfiguration(self.MICROMANAGER_CONFIG)
        self.mmc.setChannelGroup(channelGroup=self.CHANNEL_GROUP)

    def post_experiment(self):
        pass  # optional cleanup
```

For DMD support, set up `self.dmd` in `__init__()`, see `pertzlab/moench.py` for an example.

## Installation
